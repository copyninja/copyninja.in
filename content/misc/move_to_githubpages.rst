I haven't been blogging as much as I used to. For a while, I've been hosting my
blog on a single-core DigitalOcean droplet, which cost me around $7 per month.
It also hosted my mail server. Most of the time, the droplet was idle, and I
wasn't actively using my personal email much. Since it was self-hosted, I didn't
have confidence that it would always be up, so I relied on Gmail as my personal
email for everything—from banking to social media.

Now, I feel this cost is just a waste of money, even though it's not huge. So, I
decided to move my blog back to GitHub Pages, now published using GitHub
Workflows. I've stopped my mail server for the time being, and it won't be
reachable for a while. For any personal queries or comments, please reach me on
my `Personal Gmail <personal_gmail_>`_.

I'm not sure how active I'll be with blogging again, but I'll try my best to
return to my old habit of writing at least a post every week or two. Not because
people will read it, but because it gives me the option to explore new things,
experiment, and take notes along the way.
