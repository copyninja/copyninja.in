I wanted to start blogging again but I was for some reason not happy with <em>Jekyll</em> static site generator which was powering my previous site. So I took this chance to explore other static site generators and redesign my blog.</p><p>I explored a bit of Pelican, Nikola and Frog. I didn't feel comfortable with <em>Nikola</em>. <em>Frog</em> is a static site generator written using <a class="reference external" href="http://racket-lang.org/">*Racket*</a> and since I'm learning Scheme using racket I was leaning towards using it but at the last moment I decided to settle with <em>Pelican</em>. The main reason for not using <em>Frog</em> was that I just wanted to get my site up rather than waiting for me to complete learning racket and use Frog.</p><p>My feeling about Pelican is that its a nice tool and is simple and gives all basic things like generating RSS/ATOM feeds and nice theming support. In case of Jekyll I had to write custom page for creating RSS feed and had pain in creating my first theme (yeah I'm not a designer). But now things might have changed in Jekyll land but anyway I don't care anymore.</p><p>New design uses <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/DandyDev/pelican-bootstrap3">pelican-bootstrap3</a> theme and there is no comment facility available. If you want to comment or suggesting things on my post consider writing mail to me :-).</p><p>So what happened to older entries? Moving the old entries from Jekyll format to Pelican was real PITA so I just renamed my old site to <a class="reference external" href="http://blog-archive.copyninja.info">blog-archive</a>. So this is a from scratch site and will contain only new entries. So how do you like my new blog design? :-)</p></div><div id="footer"><p><italic>Tagged as: blog, jekyll, pelican, </italic></p></section></div><hr><div id="footer"> Site Proudly powered by <a href="http://getpelican.com/">Pelican</a></div></body></html>
