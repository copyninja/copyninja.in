For a while, I've been hosting my blog on a single-core DigitalOcean droplet, which cost me around $7 per month. It also hosted my mail server. Most of the time, the droplet was idle, and I wasn't actively using my personal email much. Since it was self-hosted, I didn't have confidence that it would always be up, so I relied on Gmail as my personal email for everything—from banking to social media.</p><p>Now, I feel this cost is just a waste of money, even though it's not huge. So, I decided to move my blog back to GitHub Pages, now published using GitHub Workflows. I've stopped my mail server for the time being, and it won't be reachable for a while. For any personal queries or comments, please reach me on my <a class="reference external" href="http://scr.im/vasudev">Personal Gmail</a>.</p><p>I'm not sure how active I'll be with blogging again, but I'll try my best to return to my old habit of writing at least a post every week or two. Not because people will read it, but because it gives me the option to explore new things, experiment, and take notes along the way.</p></div><div id="footer"><p><italic>Tagged as: github, pages, self-hosting, </italic></p></section></div><hr><div id="footer"> Site Proudly powered by <a href="http://getpelican.com/">Pelican</a></div></body></html>
