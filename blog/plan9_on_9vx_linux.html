I'm always baffled by the simplicity of Plan9. Sadly Plan9 never took off for whatever reasons.</p><p>I've been for a while trying to run Plan9, I ran Plan9 on Raspberry Pi model B using 9pi, but I couldn't experiment with it more due to some restrictions in my home setup.</p><p>I installed original Plan9 4th Edition from Bell labs (now part of Alcatel-Lucent), I will write about it in on different post. But running virtual machine on my system is again PITA as system is already old (3 and half year). I came across the <a class="reference external" href="http://swtch.com/9vx/">9vx</a> which is port of Plan9 for FreeBSD, Linux and Mac OSX by Russ Cox.</p><p>I downloaded original 9vx version 0.9.12 from Russ's page linked above. The archive contains a Plan9 rootfs along with precompiled 9vx binaries for Linux, FreeBSD and Mac OS X. I ran the Linux binary but it crashed.</p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>./9vx.Linux<span class="w"> </span>-u<span class="w"> </span>glenda
</pre></div><p>I was seeing some illegal instruction error in dmesg. I didn't bother to do more investigation.</p><p>A bit of googling showed me Arch Linux's <a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/9vx">wiki page on 9vx</a>. I got errors trying to compile the original vx32 from <a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/rsc/vx32">rsc's repository</a> but later saw that AUR 9vx package is built from different repository forked from rsc's found <a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/rminnich/vx32">here</a>.</p><p>I cloned the repository to local and compiled it, I don't really remember if I had installed any additional packages. But if you get error you will know what additional thing is required. After compilation the 9vx binary is found inside <cite>src/9vx/9vx</cite>. I used this newly compiled 9vx to run the the rootfs I downloaded from Russ's website.</p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>9vx<span class="w"> </span>-u<span class="w"> </span>glenda<span class="w"> </span>-r<span class="w"> </span>/path/to/extracted/9vx-0.9.12/
</pre></div><p>This launches Plan9 and allows you to work inside Plan9. The good part is its not resource hungry and still looks like you have a VM running with Plan9 on it.</p><p>But there seems to be a better way to do this directly from plan9 iso from bell labs. It can be found on <a class="reference external" href="http://9fans.net/archive/2010/10/14">9fans list</a>. Now I'm going to try that out too :-). And in next post I will share my experience of using Plan9 on Qemu.</p></div><div id="footer"><p><italic>Tagged as: 9vx, debian, plan9, </italic></p></section></div><hr><div id="footer"> Site Proudly powered by <a href="http://getpelican.com/">Pelican</a></div></body></html>
